# Release Notes

CHAOSS metrics are released continuously. The regular release is when we update the version number, update the full release notes, and make a big announcement. These releases occur one to two times a year and may correspond with the dates of a CHAOSScon event. Prior to regular release, continuous released metrics go through a comment period of at least 30 days.
