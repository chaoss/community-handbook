## Introduction

This Fork of the Community handbook contains tasks related to the Topic - Website and Metric releases. 
As a part of the Google Season of Docs interest process, I have collected all the documents related to the website and the metric releases and compiled them into present fork. These documents are stored into the folders `Metric release-review-revision` and `Website Contributing` respectively. In the following I will link these relevant documents accordingly.

I have added two files `Metric release-review-revision` and `Website Contributing` for my Google Season of Docs application. These two files contain Documents related to Contribution and Metric release, reviews, revision and are compiled from Chaoos's various Github repositories.
