# Reviewing

## Introduction <a id="introduction"></a>

Thank you so much for showing interest in D&I Badging Project and the review system. We are delighted to have you here! This page tells you a bit about the participation as a reviewer and helps with some detailed principles you would need to know while reviewing.

## Reviewer Guide <a id="reviewer-guide"></a>

A CHAOSS Badging application starts when an Applicant opens an issue on the [event](https://github.com/badging/event-diversity-and-inclusion) badging repository. They fill out a form to create a GitHub issue, which contains the content for the review. Upon being assigned an issue, a checklist is generated in the form of a comment, which will contain the name of the reviewer.

### Requirements <a id="requirements"></a>

* You need a GitHub account to review for D&I badging.
* Once you become a reviewer of D&I badging\(see [apply to review](apply-to-review.md) on how to be a reviewer\), your GitHub handle will be added to the review list to assign issues.
* Please make sure you don't miss the assigning notice, if a reviewer constantly gives no response to the issue for more than one month, D&I Badging moderator team will reassign a new reviewer for that issue.
* You can read [CHAOSS D&I metrics](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/), especially metrics under the Event Diversity focus area to get a further grasp before reviewing.

### While You Are Reviewing <a id="while-you-are-reviewing"></a>

During a review, a Reviewer would analyze the information given by an Applicant using the Review Checklist. The reviewer provides their observations according to the Review Checklist and feedback on how an application can be improved if certain checks are not met. You may find more guidance for the this process in the [review checklist](https://app.gitbook.com/@chaoss-project/s/badging/~/drafts/-MJirYUfuIbUmKKz6-6k/reviewing/review-checklist/@drafts) subsection.

### What are the things you need to review? <a id="what-are-the-things-you-need-to-review"></a>

The Event Submission is created as a GitHub issue. The reviewer's judgments are based on:

#### The Event Website <a id="the-event-website"></a>

* A link to the event website is required from applicants. Reviewers should observe the Event website to verify everything is aligned with the submission answer. This will be the most valuable resource.

#### Detailed Description <a id="detailed-description"></a>

* Each question in the application should be answered. The applicant should provide a sufficient description for the reviewer to understand how the metrics are fulfilled associated with the event.
* Each link provided should be relevant and confirm the description within a metric.

## Statement <a id="statement"></a>

Special thanks to [JOSS\(Journal of Open Source Software\)](https://joss.theoj.org/) for the D&I Badge peer-review process is inspired by them.
