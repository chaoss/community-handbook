# The Review Process

This page contains information about going through the review process, especially about how a reviewer could work with the Review Checklist and collect the information required for the Review Checklist criteria.

## **Purpose of Review Checklist** <a id="purpose-of-review-checklist"></a>

The review checklist provides a guideline for the reviewers to verify the event's alignment with CHAOSS Diversity and Inclusion best practices.

Apart from providing viewpoints while reviewing, the checklist also plays the function of generating the badge state by calculating how many checkboxes are marked in combination with all reviewers of one submission.

The event review checklist for the CHAOSS Badging Project can be found [here](https://github.com/badging/event-diversity-and-inclusion/blob/master/.github/checklist.md).

## Working with the Review Checklist <a id="working-with-the-review-checklist"></a>

Reviewers are encouraged to ask applicants for more information through an issue comment.
