## FAQ <a id="faq"></a>

`Q` What kind of commitment is the application process for an Event Badge? `A` The initial form will likely take about 15 minutes to fill out. After submitting your application, you are required to communicate, at least a few times, to ensure that the information is accurate and confusion is resolved. You must also confirm that the badge your event receives is clear.
