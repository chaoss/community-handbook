For now, most of the workflows happen under the [Event D&I badging repository.](https://github.com/badging/event-diversity-and-inclusion) If you think there is unreasonableness about the process, or you have suggestions to improve the workflow, don't hesitate to open an i**ssue** to discuss your suggestion.

### Improve the Submission Form and Review Checklist

The [Submission Form](https://chaoss.community/diversity-and-inclusion-badging/) and [Review Checklist](https://github.com/badging/event-diversity-and-inclusion/blob/master/.github/checklist.md) are two core components that compose the application and review process, the content is mostly based on [CHAOSS D&I metrics](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/). To make improvements to them, you can:
