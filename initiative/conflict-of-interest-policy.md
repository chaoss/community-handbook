# Conflict of Interest Policy

## D&I Conflict of Interest Policy <a id="d-and-i-conflict-of-interest-policy"></a>

A conflict of interest in peer review arises when a situation that you are unable to make a fair judgment. D&I Badge Project aims to promote a transparent and impartial environment to evaluate Diversity and Inclusion, as well as consciously avoiding situations where conflicts of interest may appear.

As a reviewer, COIs for **event submission reviews** are your present or previous association with any event organizers and the event committee of a submission. The following situations are considered conflicts and should be avoided:

* Being or used to be the event organizer of the submitted event.
* Having a personal relationship\(e.g.family, close friend\) with the event organizer\(s\).
* Receiving personal benefit resulting from the review.
* Recent association\(past year\) with the same organization of an applicant, for example, being employed at the same institution.

If you have a conflict of interest with a submission, you should disclose the specific reason to the moderator team. After the discussion within the moderator team, you may not be able to review the submission, but some conflicts may be recorded and then waived, and if you think you are able to make an impartial assessment of the submission, you should request that the conflict be waived.

Declaring actual, perceived, and potential conflicts of interest are required under professional ethics. If in doubt: ask the moderators.
