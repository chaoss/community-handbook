# Badging Roles

## Roles

Different roles undertake different parts of responsibilities in D&I Badging workflow. Badging roles are: **applicants, reviewers, moderators, maintainers.**  Responsibilities concerned here are to make sure submissions and reviews are working well, specifically for the GitHub related section of the workflow. 

Applicants and reviewers are the most fundamental and indispensable roles of D&I Badging, since they consist core sections of the badging workflow: applying and reviewing. Besides this, we also need moderators to coordinate between applicants and reviewers, and maintainers who are responsible for the whole project.

Click the following tab bar to see the definition of each role.

{% tab title="Reviewer" %}

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Moderator" %}
A moderator is a person who facilitates between the applicant and the reviewer within an issue.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Maintainer" %}
A maintainer is a person who takes overall responsibilities within D&I badging project, making sure everything works regularly.
{% endtab %}

As most of the responsibilities are related to the workflow on GitHub, it's important to understand that each role has its GitHub permission that specified what can do and what should be avoided. See the permission table below.
