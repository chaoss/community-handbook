# Community Guidelines

**Be welcoming and open-minded** - Other collaborators may not have the same experience level or background as you, but that doesn't mean they don't have good ideas to contribute. We encourage you to be welcoming to new collaborators and those just getting started. We value, encourage all types of contributions. We don’t assume you can contribute for free, we respect and thank.

**Be honest -** Being honest helps you to move to a better consensus building. So Be honest about who you are, what you do, and how you want to do it. Dishonesty is not only damaging to you but to all other community members and their valuable contributions. Don’t be the one bringing mistrust into this community.

**Be respectful** - We don't tolerate being disrespectful. Being a jerk will not get you a place in this community, it will turn people away so we don’t want noise in the system. Be civil and professional, and don’t post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, or hate speech. Don’t harass or grief anyone. Treat each other with dignity and consideration in all interactions. 

**Be collaborative** - Collaboration reduces redundancy and improves the quality of our work. Internally and externally, we celebrate good collaboration. Wherever possible, we work closely with upstream projects and others in the free software community to coordinate our efforts. We prefer to work transparently and involve interested parties as early as possible.

**Be mindful and stay on topic -** People use CHAOSS project for creating analytics and metrics to help define the community helath. So off-topic comments are sometimes unproductive while collaborating. Staying on topic helps produce positive and productive discussions. Additionally, communicating with strangers on the Internet can be difficult. It's hard to convey or read tone, and sarcasm is frequently misunderstood. Try to use clear language, and think about how it will be received by the other person.

**Be inclusive -** Everyone within the community has the right to speak to any decision taken. You should have freedom to participate in different decisions and actions taken within the community publically and put forward your perspective. Adding your perspective will result in a more broad outcome towards that decision. Whoever you are, you have a unique perspective and unique skills that you can contribute to a collective.

**Be focused -** We value community people's time and perspective so If you need to decide or propose something as a team or individual, make a concrete proposal with directing the focused area more clearly instead of calling a meeting to get everyone's input. Having a proposal will be a much more effective use of everyone's time.

**Share the love -** We should be appreciable for any decision/idea proposed within the community and should share some love by appreciating it. If someone achieves something within the community then share it on your social handles with your friends, let the world know, and receive some love in return.
